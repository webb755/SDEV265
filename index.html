                <h4>Game Description:</h4>

                <p>In <i>Caverns and Creatures</i>, embark on an adventure under the wing of your
                    Lore-Master or with one of our trained and experienced team members at
                    in person or online live events with Ivy Games.  Immerse yourself in a
				magical world that has been enraptured by an ancient curse.  </p>
                <p><i>Caverns and Creatures</i> takes players into the winding depths of the
                    buried old world in search of solutions to a blight on the world of
                    Sandalia.  Magic once fueled the blossom of a prosperous golden age
                    for the diverse races of the world, but that magic has begun to tear
                    at the world, creating tears in reality allowing denizens of strange
                    and often hostile realms to warp the world around them.  Those with
                    access to protective magic retreated into safe isolation leaving most
                    to fend for themselves without the means to combat the changing world.
                    <br>
                    Journey deep underground with your intrepid companions to uncover the
                    mysteries of the old world in search of the lost history of the old ones.
                    The mysteries of the corrupted ruins of the golden age may hold the key

				to restoring the world to peace and prosperity. </p>

	across the entire width of the page
	-Navigation bar: decide whether to keep vertical or change to horizontal
	-Give footer a little space from the end of the main page content & bottom
	of page. Also consider centering its content (same for horizontal Nav bar)

	JavaScript
